# 3D Heart Animation

This repository contains Python code aimed at training programming skills in Python, particularly for new enthusiasts in the field. It generates a 3D animation of a heart using Matplotlib, demonstrating the formation, collapse, and growth of a 3D heart shape.

## Features

- Utilizes NumPy for numerical calculations.
- Implements Matplotlib's animation module to create the animation.
- Displays progress using tqdm library.
- Adjustable parameters for controlling the animation sequence.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the `heart_animation.py` script.
3. View the generated animation `heart_animation.gif`.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to the following libraries:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for efficient numerical computations.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for creating visualizations and animations.
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) for providing a progress bar during animation rendering.

Feel free to explore the code and customize it to create your own animations or integrate it into your projects!
